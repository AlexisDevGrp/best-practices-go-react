                         <li>Obviously, we don't want to do that</li>
                         <li>instead we check for not nil - which typically indicates an error that will bubble up (or
                           be handled
                           properly)
                         </li>
                         <li>also, we like to define the error within the if itself - it's scoped and well contained and
                           won't be
                           overwritten accidentally
                         </li>
                         <li>what sometimes happens is that you have an argument which defines if function a or b gets
                           executed,
                           the result types being the same
                         </li>
                         <li>so here we scope all the variables, check, return</li>
                         <li>go really punishes you for nesting - that's why they have tabs with 4 spaces - adding
                           nesting should
                           hurt visually
                         </li>
                         <li>Here we see the issues of scoping, we define the error and - accidentally (this is a bug) -
                           use the
                           error in the bar statement, because e.g. copy and paste or just "routine" error handling
                         </li>
                         <li>This has happened to me at least 5 times so far, and it's especially annoying if err is nil
                           but
                           you're accessing it with e.g. this Error()
                         </li>
                         <li>then you get a nil pointer exception - so with this I want to make my point that scoping is
                           really
                           helpful
                         </li>
                         <li>if you scope properly, the compile will throw an error here!</li>

                         <li>Ok, let's touch another important topic - tests</li>
                         <li>First of all, I really like this library testify, I use it in all of my projects. The API
                           is clear,
                           never had even one breaking change, and it's capabale of expressing almost any assertion
                         </li>
                         <li>What I like to do is write a generic test that runs a bunch of "sub tests" with different
                           inputs and
                           expected outputs
                         </li>
                         <li>If you do that and these tests are not dependent on one another, you can also run them in
                           parallel
                         </li>
                         <li>So what I usually do is use range on an anonymous struct</li>
                         <li>An anonymous struct lets me define the structure of the test case inline</li>
                         <li>And then I use a shorthand to define each test case</li>
                         <li>And finally, you simply execute a sub test - that's it!</li>
                       </ul>

              Personally, i hate mocking language level API calls (e.g. interfaces) - there's a couple of reasons
              <ul>
                <li>It's always very close to the original code - so for example with things like "once" or
                  "everytime"
                </li>
                <li>This leads to very tight coupling between tests and code and can be extremely annoyoing during
                  refactoring
                </li>
                <li>Typically used for databases or http servers - but we don't actually check our code against the
                  database but against a representation with potentially wrong assumptions
                </li>
                <li>of course, there are some valid use cases for mocking, for example here</li>

              <ul>
                <li>Ok, so before we go a step further and look at how you can avoid mocking and get equal or even more
                  insightful test results, let's look at our typical CRUD server
                </li>
                <li>So, typically we have an HTTP handler</li>
                <li>A DBAL</li>
                <li>An implementation of the DBAL for example for PG or an in memory adapter for testing</li>
                <li>Good developers document their APIs with swagger or openapi spec</li>
                <li>And if you have that you can easily generate an http client for any language</li>
                <li>And it even makes sense to have one for Go because you can quickly (like in a few hours) write together a CLI that helps devs use your API</li>
                <li>So if we have all of that in place - my personal opinion is to avoid unit tests here</li>
                <li>Why should we unit test the http handler? wouldn't it make more sense to actually have an integration test here? like test everything from proper en/decoding up to database storage</li>

                       <ul>
                         <li>The Go authors see that similarly which is why they included helpers for integration tests but not mocking in the stdlib</li>
                         <li>So, if we want to avoid mocking language-level API calls, we need to use something else
                         </li>
                         <li>I use httptest everywhere, typically, I wire everything up from the client making the
                           request, to the http server, to the http handler function, to the database connectivity, to
                           the database
                         </li>
                         <li>This ensures that everything runs together rather smoothly</li>
                         <li>And then I use a few limited (unit) tests to test units which really need it - e.g.
                           algorithms, validators, ...
                         </li>
                         <li>So using http test is really straight forward - it's even in the stdlib</li>
                         <li>We import it, we set up the server with the handler (you could use any router here)</li>
                         <li>And then you simply call the get function... that's it!</li>
                         <li>So now, instead of mocking this or doing other crazy things - we can actually see: did the
                           headers work, does the response status look correct? what about decoding and encoding?
                         </li>
                         <li>Setting this up is sometimes cumbersome - especially if authorization is involved - but
                           it's worth the extra time, because you save so much time by not unit testing everything and
                           compiling and setting up hundreds of mocks

                         <li>In go, no decent ORM exists, because it's a bit difficult to achieve that with a
                           not-so-straight-forward OOP language
                         </li>
                         <li>Instead, you typically write SQL statements</li>
                         <li>So how do you test that? well, you boot up a database in docker, conenct to it, and see if
                           it works.
                         </li>
                         <li>To do that, I wrote dockertest which is available on github</li>

                 <ul>
                   <li>A good idea is to bubble up the state handling and write primitive components that take, for
                     example, callbacks to update state
                   </li>
                   <li>This is quite common if you use state management like redux</li>
                   <li>Another good practice is to use functional components (which are a bit faster) if you don't need
                     access to react's lifecycle methods
                   </li>
                   <li>Another one is to define functions outside of the render function as to avoid re-initialization
                     of that function on every render call
                   </li>
                   <li>And I really like to write abstract change handlers like here</li>

                       <li>The last topic I want to briefly touch is testing components</li>
                       <li>This can be very hard because I think that testing view logic is subject to so much change
                       </li>
                       <li>While structure shouldn't really dictate layout - it's just the way HTML + CSS works</li>
                       <li>So often we end up writing a component, test it, and a few weeks later have to refactor it
                         completely, also rendering the tests unusable
                       </li>
                       <li>There are also different ways of testing react components - some are just checking for
                         structure of the component
                       </li>
                       <li>I use enzyme from airbnb which allows me to render single components up to a full
                         application
                       </li>
                       <li>This really helps with writing integration tests</li>
